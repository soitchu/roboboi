# Bot for GU cpsc discord
The actual bot is roboboi.js which is in the src directory. The hugemoji code is located there.
<br/>

The components directory contains extra files related to operation (all directories have READMEs).

The primary driver of the role-call functionality is RoleCall.js, which I have now wrapped into its own package and published: 
* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/wakfi/discord-role-call)<br/>
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord-role-call/v/1.0.3)
